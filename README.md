I have created a website based on "Tourism Management" it is a "Maldives Tourism Booking website" using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap(Framework), Javascript.

The website concentrates on the basis of user friendly approach to book their slots in Maldives. The project focus on to both Admin side(Backend) as well as User Interface(Frontend). The user can book the Activities/Hotels/Spa Resorts in Maldives by visiting the Website. The booking details are visible to admin side and it is private too.
